A sniper is a military/paramilitary marksman who engages targets from positions of concealment 
or at distances exceeding the target's detection capabilities.
Snipers generally have specialized training and are equipped with high-precision rifles.
<b>Etymology</b>
The name "sniper" comes from the verb "to snipe", which originated in the 1770s among 
soldiers in British India in reference to shooting snipes.
