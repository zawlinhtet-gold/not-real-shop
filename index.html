    <h1>Welcome To My Weapons Shop</h1>
    <p>
        Weapons are tools and objects designed for hunting or combat. The most common types of weapons were bows,
        arrows, spears, pikes, and swords.
        <br>
        Other weapons were axes, favored by the Dwarves and few Elves (such as Rog).
        <br>
        Most of the boys like guns among them because it is powerful and easy to use. I like guns too. But, It is
        dangerous to use.

            Biological weapons are toxic materials produced from pathogenic organisms (usually microbes) or artificially
            manufactured toxic substances that are used to intentionally interfere with the biological processes of a
            host.
        </li>

            These substances work to kill or incapacitate the host.

            Weapons are used to increase the efficacy and efficiency of activities such as hunting, crime, law
            enforcement, self-defense, and warfare.

            In broader context, weapons may be construed to include anything used to gain a tactical, strategic, 
            <br>
            material or mental advantage over an adversary or enemy target.
