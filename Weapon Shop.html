        A machine gun is an auto-firing, rifled long-barrel autoloading firearm designed for sustained direct fire with
        fully powered cartridges.
        <br>
        Other automatic firearms such as assault rifles and automatic rifles are typically designed more
        <br>
        for firing short bursts rather than continuous firepower, and not considered machine guns.

        pistol, small firearm designed for one-hand use.
        <br>
        According to one theory, pistols owe their name to the city of Pistoia, Italy, where handguns were made
        <br>
        as early as the late 15th century.
        <br>
        A semi-automatic pistol is a type of handgun that uses a single chamber and barrel.
        <br>
        The pistol fires a chambered round, extracts and ejects the empty
        <br>
        casing and then loads a new round into the chamber (if additional rounds are in the magazine)
        <br>
        with each trigger pull.

    <p>
        'Kalashnikov's automatic [rifle]'; also known as the Kalashnikov or just AK), is a gas-operated assault rifle
        <br>
        that is chambered for the 7.62Ã—39mm cartridge.
        <br>
        Developed in the Soviet Union by Russian small-arms designer Mikhail Kalashnikov, it is the originating
        <br>
        firearm of the Kalashnikov (or "AK") family of rifles.
        <br>
        The standard AK-47 assault rifle soon morphed through a series of generational
        <br>
        updates over the past three-quarters of a century to become the AKM, AK-103/104,
        <br>
        AK-109, AEK-973, and others, all in the same caliber. Eventually, the AK was also
        <br>
        ported over to the increasingly popular pistol format, and the AK pistol was born.

        A grenade is an explosive weapon typically thrown by hand,
        but can also refer to a shell shot from the muzzle of a rifle 
        or a grenade launcher. A modern hand grenade generally consists 
        of an explosive charge, a detonator mechanism, an internal striker 
        to trigger the detonator, and a safety lever secured by a linchpin.
